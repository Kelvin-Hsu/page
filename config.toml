        content = "Hi, I'm Kelvin. I am currently completing my PhD in Machine Learning at [The University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au/) and [Data61, CSIRO](https://www.data61.csiro.au/). I am fascinated by the mathematics and statistics behind the most sophisticated learning and inference algorithms that underpin modern artificial intelligence. I believe that the world is not only a better place, but also a more interesting one when viewed from a data-centric and learning-centric perpespective. My research interests are broadly at the union of approximate Bayesian inference, implicit and intractable models, kernel mean embeddings of distributions, and deep learning, working with [Fabio Ramos](http://www-personal.usyd.edu.au/~framos) and [Richard Nock](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rnock/). <br> <br> Throughout my years at the university, I also grew to enjoy teaching. Over the last 6 years I have tutored 9 courses at the [School of Computer Science](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-computer-science.html), [School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-aerospace-mechanical-and-mechatronic-engineering.html), [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/), and [School of Business Analytics](http://sydney.edu.au/business/business_analytics). They range from courses at the first year undergraduate level to capstone units at the postgraduate level in Machine Learning, Data Science, Mathematical Statistics, Software Engineering, Systems Engineering, Control Theory, Space Engineering, and Risk Management. Teaching highly technical subjects to a wide variety of audiences of contrasting backgrounds is an immensely challenging and rewarding experience. Over the years, teaching has become a core part of my identity that shapes the way I do things even outside of teaching. I have learned so many lessons from teaching itself that I apply these lessons constantly in my everyday life. <br> <br> When I am not doing research or teaching, you can find me busking on the streets of Sydney on weekends or Friday nights with our acoustic band, [YueAcoustic](https://www.facebook.com/yueacoustics/). We now perform weekly at a local restaurant."
