      <description>At the welcome reception during the first night of the conference, our paper was announced the Best Student Paper Award Winner at the European Conference on Machine Learning 2018!
My talk was originally scheduled two days later for 20 minutes. With this announcement though, this meant that my talk was to be presented to the entire conference, moved 1 day earlier to the very next morning, and also doubled in time to 40 minutes.</description>

      <description>The greatest gift from the act of teaching is the lesson of empathy. Before someone can understand you, you must first understand them.
Teaching has truly taught me so many important lessons. It teaches me about the beauty of constrasting experiences and thoughts. It teaches me about that communication is always a two way street. It teaches me that the audience and their frame of mind is always the most critical to the success and effectiveness of a presentation.</description>
