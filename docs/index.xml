      <description>Abstract  Conditional mean embeddings are nonparametric models that encode conditional expectations in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. While they provide a flexible and powerful framework for probabilistic inference, their performance is highly dependent on the choice of kernel and regularization hyperparameters. Nevertheless, current hyperparameter tuning methods predominantly rely on expensive cross validation or heuristics that is not optimized for the inference task. For conditional mean embeddings with categorical targets and arbitrary inputs, we propose a hyperparameter learning framework based on Rademacher complexity bounds to prevent overfitting by balancing data fit against model complexity.</description>

      <description>The greatest gift from the act of teaching is the lesson of empathy. Before someone can understand you, you must first understand them.
Teaching has truly taught me so many important lessons. It teaches me about the beauty of constrasting experiences and thoughts. It teaches me about that communication is always a two way street. It teaches me that the audience and their frame of mind is always the most critical to the success and effectiveness of a presentation.</description>
