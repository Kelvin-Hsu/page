      <description>The greatest gift from the act of teaching is the lesson of empathy. Before someone can understand you, you must first understand them.
Teaching has truly taught me so many important lessons. It teaches me about the beauty of constrasting experiences and thoughts. It teaches me about that communication is always a two way street. It teachees me that the audience and their frame of mind is always the most critical to the success and effectiveness of a presentation.</description>
