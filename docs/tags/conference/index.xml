      <description>Michele announcing the Best Student Machine Learning Paper Award Winner at the Mansion House Dublin At the welcome reception during the first night of the conference, our paper was announced the Best Student Paper Award Winner at the European Conference on Machine Learning 2018!
My talk was originally scheduled two days later for 20 minutes. With this announcement though, this meant that my talk was to be presented to the entire conference, moved 1 day earlier to the very next morning, and also doubled in time to 40 minutes.</description>
